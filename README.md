## About the Project

An open-source app to help developers create quality readmes for their Github repos. As the saying goes, the first impression is the last impression, a well-structured readme is likely the first piece of documentation a visitor will see. Readme-Generator vows to help you create amazing readmes to make a lasting first impression.

Open-source contribution is all about freedom, transparency and community. The contributors play a vital role in the open-source community. Contributing to open-source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine. Hence, we welcome all the developers out there to come and contribute.
